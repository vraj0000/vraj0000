- 👋 Hi, I’m @vraj0000 {Vraj Desai}. I Love computers! And love designing fast dedicated hardware for a task or as known as ASIC.
- 👀 I’m interested in Deep Learning, Game Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SNN (Spiking Neural Network), and it's implementation on analog hardware.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ASIC design, CPU/GPU design, and Physics Engine.
- 📫 How to reach me linkdin, Gmail.

## Projects I worked on are
- 4x4 Vadic Multiplier.
- Analog implementation of Neural Network.
- bokeh blur using complex gaussian functoin.
- Image to text conversion using convolution neural network.
- Automatic object catcher.
- Design of Chebyshev, Elliptical, and Butterworth Filter.
- using GAN and RNN to create text.
- Physics Engine.
- An OpenGL bolier libary.
