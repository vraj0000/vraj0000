- 👋 Hi, I’m @vraj0000
- 👀 I’m interested in Deep Learning, Game Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OpenGL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Physics Engine.
- 📫 How to reach me ...

## Projects I worked on are
- 4x4 Vadic Multiplier.
- Analog implementation of Neural Network :-
To implement Neural Network in analog domain to increase performance using
contenus processing and consuming less power as transistor conus can be
reduced. A neuron can be made with a current adder while resistor can act
as weight and for activation function we can implement ReLU with a diode
or transistor as a diode Making a neuron
- bokeh blur using complex gaussian functoin.
- Image to text conversion using convolution neural network.
- Automatic object catcher.
- Design of Chebyshev, Elliptical, and Butterworth Filter.
- using GAN and RNN to create text.
- Physics Engine.
- An OpenGL bolier libary.
